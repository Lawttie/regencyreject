Human settlement on the contient of North America began at least 15 000 years ago, bands of people came from Siberia by water or across, a now vanished, land bridge into Alaska. These first Americans spread southward and eastward,
Various tribes set up settlements across the continent. By 1500, the North American population was an estimated 7 to 10 million people. Millions more lived in South, and Central America. The civilisations remained unknown to the Europeans,
until voyages began in the late 1400s. During the late fifteenth century, Italian explorer, Christopher Colombus was seeking a quicker route to Asia, and so tried going westward. On August 3rd 1492 Colombus set out from Palos, Spain, bound 
for Asia, arriving in the Caribbean. Colombus spread ideals of Christianity to these newly dubbed "Indians", and this spread across the continent, with more European settlers being sent out from various countries. Spanish settlements began in Florida,
and in New Mexico, as well as in the Caribbean, Mexico, and both Central snd South America, bringing a tide of Spanish-speakers, as well as Catholic missionaires. The Dutch soon followed, sending navigators, and setting up Nieuw Amsterdam (now New York).
The English followed, and along with its Protestant reformation, brought strong Protestant figures and views to its new American colonies. England's first foothold in North America was in Virginia, named after Elizabeth I. More English colonies
spread southward, moving downwards through the Carolinas, and to Georgia, eventually encountering Spain's hold in Florida.
