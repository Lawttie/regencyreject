    <h1 id="">The German Empire (The Kaiserreich) 1871-1918</h1>
    <p>
Until 1871, Germany was a patchwork of 27 states of varying sizes, all of which had their own rules, laws, even different religious views. They were ruled by hereditary Kings, Princes, and Dukes. In a sense, 
Austria could be seen as the 28th state which didn't join the empire initially. When it finally did during WWI it tripled the size of the German Empire. Hitler himself was Austrian, and was always aware of its potential.
In 1871 all of the states united into one German Empire, this seriously upset the balance of power in the European continent. <br>
The largest of the states was Prussia, who tended to dominate the others. Between all 27 of the states there was a unifiying feature, that was the German language, and culture. They had all been pushed around a lot
by other great European powers since the medieval period, because they had never worked together. Many German nationalists by the late 19th cenutryy felt that to bring them all together as one unified country
would make the greatest power in Europe. The man who would achieve this feat was Otto von Bismarck, and the state which he led would dominate the new Germany, that being Prussia.
